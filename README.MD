multi task classification unexplored for topological materials 

we show that considering elementary band representations of 2d and 3d topological materials along with synthesis with traditional data driven materials classification techniques and databases proves to offer advantage as symmetry of materials are known.

~ create algos for novel classification schemes useful for future generative modelling work
